# GPT-2 Text Generation Web Application

## Overview
This project is a web-based text generation application built using the GPT-2 language model from Hugging Face.  
It allows users to enter a text prompt and generate coherent, human-like text through an interactive web interface powered by Gradio.

The project demonstrates the practical application of pre-trained Transformer models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks without training a model from scratch.

---

## Key Features
- Pre-trained GPT-2 text generation model
- Interactive web interface using Gradio
- Adjustable text generation parameters:
  - Maximum New Tokens
  - Temperature (controls creativity)
- Automatic detection of CPU or GPU
- Public shareable demo link

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Gradio
- Google Colab

---

## System Architecture
1. User provides a text prompt through the UI  
2. GPT-2 tokenizer converts text into tokens  
3. GPT-2 model generates new tokens using sampling  
4. Tokens are decoded back into readable text  
5. Generated text is displayed to the user  

---

## Installation
Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install gradio transformers torch
````

---

## Usage

Run the application in Python or Google Colab:

```python
demo.launch(share=True)
```

This starts the Gradio server and generates a public URL for accessing the application.

---

## Example

### Input Prompt

```
Once upon a time in a small village
```

### Sample Output

```
Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a young boy who dreamed of adventure...
```

(Output may vary based on parameter settings.)

---

## Parameter Description

* **Max New Tokens**: Determines the length of the generated text
* **Temperature**:

  * Low value → more predictable output
  * High value → more creative output

---

## Deployment

For permanent hosting, deploy the application using Hugging Face Spaces:

```bash
gradio deploy
```

---

## Limitations

* GPT-2 may generate biased, incorrect, or incomplete content
* Output quality depends heavily on the input prompt
* Not suitable for sensitive or factual-critical applications

---

## Future Enhancements

* Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces with GPU support
* Add text download and history tracking
* Upgrade to larger language models
* Improve UI design and performance
